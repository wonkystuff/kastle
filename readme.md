# This fork

This fork by wonkystuff (https://wonkystuff.net/) is intended to contain modifications of the original Kastle (& drum)
that will be able to run on the **wonkystuff** _core1_ device (most usefully on the **core1.æ** version for the Tangible Waves
AE Modular synthesiser).

Preliminary updates are expected to be in formatting and tidying up commented-out code! After that, who knows.

Of course, any modifications are also released under the CC-BY-SA license.
